# AutoValue: Gson Extension

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rharter/auto-value-gson.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rharter/auto-value-gson)

An extension for Google's [AutoValue](https://github.com/google/auto) that creates a simple [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) TypeAdapterFactory for each AutoValue annotated object.

## Usage

Simply include auto-value-gson in your project and add a public static method to your `@AutoValue` 
annotated class returning a TypeAdapter.  You can also annotate your properties using 
`@SerializedName` to define an alternate name for de/serialization.

```java
@AutoValue public abstract class Foo {
  abstract String bar();
  @SerializedName("Baz") abstract String baz();

  // The public static method returning a TypeAdapter<Foo> is what
  // tells auto-value-gson to create a TypeAdapter for Foo.
  public static TypeAdapter<Foo> typeAdapter(Gson gson) {
    return new AutoValue_Foo.GsonTypeAdapter(gson);
  }
}

final Gson gson = new GsonBuilder()
  .registerTypeAdapterFactory(new AutoValueGsonTypeAdapterFactory())
  .create();
```

Now build your project and de/serialize your Foo.

## Factory

Optionally, auto-value-gson can create a single [TypeAdapterFactory](https://google.github.io/gson/apidocs/com/google/gson/TypeAdapterFactory.html) so
that you don't have to add each generated TypeAdapter to your Gson instance manually.

To generate a `TypeAdapterFactory` for all of your auto-value-gson classes, simply create
an abstract class that implements `TypeAdapterFactory` and annotate it with `@GsonTypeAdapterFactory`,
and auto-value-gson will create an implementation for you.  You simply need to provide a static
factory method, just like your AutoValue classes, and you can use the generated `TypeAdapterFactory`
to help Gson de/serialize your types.

```java
@GsonTypeAdapterFactory
public abstract class MyAdapterFactory implements TypeAdapterFactory {

  // Static factory method to access the package
  // private generated implementation
  public static TypeAdapterFactory create() {
    return new AutoValueGson_MyAdapterFactory();
  }
  
}
```

Then you simply need to register the Factory with Gson.

```java
Gson gson = new GsonBuilder()
    .registerTypeAdapterFactory(MyAdapterFactory.create())
    .build();
```
